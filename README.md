GS - 12/10/2019 - Wrote program in C and got it working. I hardcoded answer into an array for now. We need to:
    1. Read the answer from a file
    2. Create vectors
    3. Create a stack to store the guesses and undo them.
    4. Create classes for everything, including drawing the hangman and displaying the guesses
